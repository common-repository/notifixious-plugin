This a plugin for Wordpress that uses the [Notifixio.us](http://www.notifixio.us) API. Notifixious is a simple notification service that allows websites to notify their users when they publish new content, on the channels they like. Currently, we support many IM flavors, as well as Email and Text Messages (US Only)

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to *notify* your readers on their *Instant Messaging (AIM, MSN, GTalk, ICQ...), Email or SMS* when you publish *new posts*! It also adds a widget to your blog to allow your users to choose on which channel they want to be notified!

Why do you want your user to be notified when you publish a new article?

* Increased loyalty!
* Faster spread for your posts: it's actually immediate!
* RSS is somehow broken: your readers (do they all know RSS?) have to start a reader to know that you published a new article
* They can Digg, Twit', Share on Facebook or save your post to Delicious!

Check the [Notifixious](http://www.notifixio.us) for further information.

== Installation ==

This plugin follows the [standard WordPress installation method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins):

1. Upload the notifixous folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin through the 'Notifixious' section of the 'Options' menu (a few more clicks for months of happiness!)
4. Add the widget to your template!
